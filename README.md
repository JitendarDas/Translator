A BASIC VOICE TRANSLATOR is a system that listens an audio of a language and converts its it into a desired language in audio form.
Working :
1) Speech Recognition: It captures speech input using the microphone and converts it to text in English.
2) Translation: The recognized text is translated into Hindi using Google Translate.
3) Text-to-Speech: The translated Hindi text is converted into audio using gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech).
4) Audio Playback: The generated audio is saved as an MP3 file and then played back to the user.
